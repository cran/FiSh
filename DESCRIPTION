Description: Proposes non-parametric estimates of the Fisher information measure and the 
              Shannon entropy power. More theoretical and implementation details can be found
              in Guignard et al. <doi:10.3389/feart.2020.00255>. A 'python' version of this
              work is available on 'github' and 'PyPi' ('FiShPy').
